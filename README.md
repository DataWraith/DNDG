# DNDG

DNDG is a very simple interactive fiction game.

I mostly just wanted to be able to say "I made a game", since I've always
wanted to do that. But alas, my abilities are not sufficient for a 'real' game,
so I thought I'd try the simplest thing that could possibly work, and hammer it
out within a couple of days.

This software could be improved in so many ways, but as it stands, it's
a simple game engine that works. Not elegantly, but it works. I've decided to
call it 'done' for now, unless someone actually has a good idea for a game, in
which case I'd probably rewrite the thing from scratch. XD

## Sample run

	You are standing in front of a wrought iron gate. It is fairly massive, with
	spikes on top. The gate is currently closed, and next to it is a stone wall
	three meters in height.

	A rugged asphalt road is running beside the gate in north-south direction. Not
	a single car is in sight. On the other side of the road, there is nothing of
	interest. Only barren dry-land as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the
	occasional bush. The bushes don't look very healthy either.

	> look at gate

	The gate is an intricately wrought-iron structure. It is currently closed. The
	bars form the initials 'DNDG', and you idly wonder whether that stands for "Do
	not dare to go in" or other equally unpleasant expansions of the acronym.

	> stomp ants

	There are no ants here.

	> examine wall

	A fairly smooth and featureless wall made out of stone bricks.

	> open gate

	You depress the handle and push, but the gate does not budge. Apparently it is
	locked.

	> climb over the gate

	The spikes on top of the gate look quite menacing, and the smooth stone walls
	on either side don't look very climbable either. You decide to try something
	else.

	> jump over the wall
	> [autocorrected] jump over gate

	You'd need to be an olympic athlete to jump that high. And you'd need to know
	how to pole vault. And you'd need a pole. And you'd need to not impale yourself
	on the gate's spikes...

	> look at road

	It's an asphalt road. The lane markings are old and faded out, and dust covers
	much of the surface. You notice ants scurring around some of the cracks in the surface.

	> look at ants

	Little reddish-brown ants are scurrying around on the surface of the road. You
	could stomp on them, but they're probably too tiny to actually get squished by
	that. Besides, what have they done to you, to deserve such a fate?

	> stomp ants

	Seriously? Oh, okay...

	You try to stomp the ants, but nothing satisfying happens.

	> x bushes
	> [autocorrected] examine bushes

	You cross the road to look at the nearest bush. The leaves look dry. The bush
	seems to need watering.

	> water bushes

	Very funny. You don't even have any water to quench your own thirst.

	> go south

	To the west is a relatively smooth stone wall. A road is running in north-south
	direction. On the other side of the road is dry-land with some bushes scattered
	about, but no clear destination in sight.

	> s
	> [autocorrected] go south

	You continue walking south, but all you can see is that stupid wall and the
	deserted road.

	> north
	> [autocorrected] go north

	You walk north until you are back at the gate.

	> n
	> [autocorrected] go north

	To the west is a smooth stone wall. The road is running in north-south
	direction to your right.

	> go north

	To the west is a smooth stone wall. The road is running in north-south
	direction to your right.

	Despite its overall smoothness, some of the bricks in the wall appear to be
	cracked.

	> go north

	You notice a small fountain set into the wall to the west. There are some
	bushes on the other side of the road.

	A key is lying in the fountain's basin.

	> drink
	> [autocorrected] drink water

	You're not sure if it is such a great idea to drink water from a random
	fountain in the middle of nowhere, but you're very thirsty by now. You scoop up
	the water with both hands and drink, repeatedly.

	> drink water

	You're not really thirsty anymore.

	> x key
	> [autocorrected] examine fountain

	There is a key lying in the basin of the little fountain. Water is splashing
	right on top of it.

	> take the key

	You take the key out of the fountain's basin and shake the water off. You
	pocket the key.

	> x fountain
	> [autocorrected] examine fountain

	A lively little fountain. There is nothing special about it.

	> x bushes
	> [autocorrected] examine bushes

	The bushes look dried out and unhealthy. You could probably scoop up a little
	water from the fountain, carry it across the road, and water the plants.

	> water plants
	> [autocorrected] water bushes

	You scoop up a handfull of water and carry it across the road. Most of the
	water doesn't make it across the road, but you imagine that the bush you just
	watered at least a little, is thankful and owes you something. Or something.

	> go south

	To the west is a smooth stone wall. The road is running in north-south
	direction to your east.

	> go south

	You walk south until you are back at the gate.

	> use key on gate
	> [autocorrected] unlock gate

	You take the key from your pocket and insert it into the lock of the gate. It fits!
	You turn the key. With a loud click, the gate unlocks.

	> open gate

	You depress the handle and push. The gate swings open with an ear-rending
	creaking noise.

	> look at gate

	The gate is an intricately wrought-iron structure. It is slightly ajar. The
	bars form the initials 'DNDG', and you idly wonder whether that stands for "Do
	not dare to go in" or other equally unpleasant expansions of the acronym.

	> go through the gate

	Behind the gate is a gravel path that leads to an oddly familiar house. Hey,
	this is your house! But what is it doing here, in the middle of nowhere?

	The door is slightly ajar, and you enter. You make for your own room. You see
	yourself sleeping in your bed. Suddenly you are in the bed, and as you open
	your eyes, you realize that you had a rather strange dream. You wonder idly
	what the gate and the key represent in your subconsciousness, and which
	real-life abilities or feelings you might have locked away...

	*** YOU'VE WON THE GAME ***

	Enter 'exit' to quit.

	> xyzzy

	Nothing happens.

	> exit
